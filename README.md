# Alzheimer's Detection 🧠

This project utilizes Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI scans) as input to predict the presence of Alzheimer's disease. 

## Overview ℹ️

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management of the disease. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing MRI scans and predicting the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease.

## Features 🚀

- **MRI Image Processing**: Input MRI scans are processed using machine learning algorithms to extract relevant features.
- **Prediction**: The trained model analyzes the extracted features to predict the presence of Alzheimer's disease.
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: The accuracy of the prediction model is evaluated using validation datasets.

## Installation 💻

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage 📋

1. Prepare MRI scans in the appropriate format.
2. Run the prediction script: `python predict.py <input-image>`
3. View the prediction results.
